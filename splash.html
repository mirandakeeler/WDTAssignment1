		            <p>This is your average game of chess. You will be randomly assigned a color (black or white). Possible moves of pieces will be displayed to you if you click on the piece you would like to move. Check will be announced when you or your opponent has a piece in place to check the other's King. Each player will have a maximum of 5 minutes to make a move. If you do not make a move within this alloted time, you automatically lose. If you abruptly exit the game, nothing will be saved (will not count as a win or lose).</p>
